 Varanasi Software Junction Repository on JSP and Servlets.
 We start with certain definitions.
 
 What is the Internet?
 Internet is short for internetwork. Internetwork is a connection of more than one network.
 
 What is the web?
The web is that part of the Internet that works on the HTTP.

What is the HTTP?
HTTP is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
Hyper Text is active text. This means that Hyper Text is responsive. HtML responds to user interaction for example hyperlinks transfer from one URI to URI.
Transfer obviously refers to transfer of data.
Protocol is a set of rules that is required whenever more than one processses interact.
HTTP has two main characteristics
1. HTTP is connectionless. Connecctionless means that HTTP connections are connected only for the actual duratio of data transfer which is unlike normal phone calls.
2. HTTP is stateless. Stateless means every request-response cycle is considered to be only request. No history of requests is maintained.

What is a Server , and what is a Client?
Consider a situation where telephone T1 is calling T2.
The phone T1 is the Client and T2 is Server.
In HTTP terms the server is the website and the client is the browser.
We will be using glassfish server and chrome browser.

What is a Servlet?
Servlet is a Java Program that can be accessed using the HTTP.
JSP  or Java Server Page--- Allows mixing of Java and HTML in the same program.
